#Vault is deployed on Windows Machine
#EDB is deployed on Linux Machine
#Vault and EDB is in an airgapped environment, so we will be using Private IPv4

Download the Vault Binary : 
Choose : https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/vault_1.19.0+ent

Once downloaded, Right-click the ZIP file and select Extract All….
In the Extract to field, enter C:\Vault\

1.1 Verify that the download works
Open File Explorer > This PC > C:\ and go to C:\Vault\.

#You will have to close and reopen Powershell
Verify that Vault can be run on Powershell
vault --version

Save your license in license.hclic in C:\vault

Run this on POWERSHELL
$env:VAULT_LICENSE = Get-Content "C:\vault\license.hclic" -Raw

Load up the environment
$env:VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"

Once the license is loaded; run where vault if its c:\vault\vault then run : 
C:\vault\vault server -config="C:\vault\server.hcl"

1.4 Initialise Vault 
vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1

vault operator unseal <unseal key>

vault login <root key>

Enable Audit Logging : 
vault audit enable file file_path=C:\vault\vault_audit.log

Open up Vault UI : 
http://127.0.0.1:8200

2.1 Enable KMIP
vault secrets enable kmip

Ask Vault to listen on port 5696 (typical port for KMIP) 
vault write kmip/config listen_addrs=0.0.0.0:5696

2.2 Add EDB server Private IP address to Vault KMIP
Go to Vault UI > KMIP > Configuration > add EDB Server Private IP address to Vault KMIP

Download the CA.cert, this cert is created when you enable KMIP engine

2.3 Create Scope and Role
vault write -f kmip/scope/edb

KMIP Scope is for organizing and managing keys, while the KMIP Role defines the permissions that clients have within that scope.

A role defines the permissions for accessing and managing keys in a given scope. When integrating with EDB, you will configure a role that specifies what Vault operations (such as key creation, key retrieval, or key deletion) the EDB instance can perform via the KMIP protocol.
(https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/enterprise/kmip-engine#manage-kmip-roles)

vault write kmip/scope/edb/role/edb-all operation_all=true

2.4 Get the credentials (key.pem.ec and cert.pem) 
The resulting credential.json contains the certificates that your KMIP client will use to establish a connection with Vault KMIP server. (which is your key.pem.ec and cert.pem) 
vault write -format=json kmip/scope/edb/role/edb-all/credential/generate format=pem | ConvertFrom-Json | Out-File -FilePath credential.json; Get-Content credential.json

From Vault end you would have 
1. Enabled KMIP secret engine 
2. Added EDB Private IPv4 Address in the CA cert 
3. Enabled Audit Logging 
4. Gotten a ca.cert, key.pem.ec and cert.pem
